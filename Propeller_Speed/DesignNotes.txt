General Design:
 * Input pins count number of falling edges on signal coming from the sensor (=2*rotor revolutions)
 * Timer counts 1 second intervals, then reads from each interrupt counter, divides by 2 to get rotations per second
 * 4 seconds worth of data is averaged together
 * On button press, averaged value for each motor is displayed on UART terminal

GPIO Requirements:
 * 5V tolerant inputs
 * Utilize pins connected to headers on Nucleo board
 * Each input pin has its own interrupt for falling-edge trigger

GPIO Selection:
 * PA10 - D2 - Motor 1 - EXTI10
 * PB5 - D4 - Motor 2 - EXTI5
 * PB4 - D5 - Motor 3 - EXTI4
 * PA8 - D8 - Motor 4 - EXTI8

Timers:
 * Count to 1 second
 * Use TIMER2 - 32-bit timer
 * Driven off of 84MHz clock
 * To count to 1 second, with prescaler of 1, 84000000 is the ARR value
